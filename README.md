# PLL_trainer
Very basic program for training PLL algorithms for the Rubik's cube. Has the functionality of not repeating algorithms that one already knows/ is confident with.

Project is unfinished and needs to be updated with a better method of algorithms selection and a cube solver that can be used to generate the scrambles instead of saving them.
